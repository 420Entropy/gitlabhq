    With GitLab 17.0 we're upgrading the container-optimized operating system ([COS](https://cloud.google.com/container-optimized-os/docs))
    of the ephemeral VMs used to execute jobs for [Hosted Runners on Linux](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/runners/saas/linux_saas_runner.html).
    The COS upgrade includes a Docker Engine upgrade from Version 19.03.15 to Version 23.0.5, which introduced
    a known compatibility issue.

    GitLab CI/CD jobs [using Docker-in-Docker-based jobs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/docker/using_docker_build.html#use-docker-in-docker)
    with a Docker-in-Docker service version prior to 20.10 and GitLab CI/CD jobs [using Kaniko to build container images](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/docker/using_kaniko.html)
    with a Kaniko service version older than `v1.9.0` will start failing.

    To fix these issues, an update of service version in `.gitlab-ci.yml` is required.

    Both issues, including a detailed explanation of how they affect jobs and how to fix
    the issue, are described
    [in the announcement blog post](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2023/10/04/updating-the-os-version-of-saas-runners-on-linux/).
